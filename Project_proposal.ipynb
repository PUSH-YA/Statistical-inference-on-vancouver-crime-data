    "<span style=\"color: black;\">In our STAT201 group project, we propose the following question of interest: **How does the proportion of violent and non violent crimes vary throughout the day?** With the rise of unprovoked stranger attacks and safety concerns for Vancouverites, we will seek to better understand the relation of criminal activity and time of day. The data is provided by the Vancouver Police Department on the open source “geodash” website. We will be using the data from 2003 to 2022 for all neighborhoods within the Vancouver municipal proper. The goal of this study is to understand if daytime and nighttime hours tend to harbour different types of crimes, which may be useful in further inferences about the motivations behind such crimes (CS Wisdom et H. Torch). These trends can also assist in predicting criminal activity and developing preventive and punitive methods to reduce crime, and understand the underlying social problems conducive to crimes (University of Minnesota).</span>"

    "<span style=\"color: black;\">In our preliminary and exploratory analysis, we downloaded the dataset as csv and imported it into R. We immediately noticed that there are spikes in the distribution around midnight, noon, and to a lesser extent at regular intervals (hourly, 30-minutes, 15-minutes, etc.). We assumed this to be an artifact of estimating crime time in instances where the precise time is unknown. To counteract this problem, we used a histogram to bin the dataset by the hour and removed values at midnight and noon. This may cause the unintended effect of removing useful data. However, as we are comparing the two groups by daytime and nighttime, it should have little effect on the proportions calculated. The histograms in question are shown below:</span>"
